Relavence Questions:
	1: One of my favorite games is definitely Minecraft. It has so much potential whether you want to play solo
	survival, minigames on servers, or even other games inside of this one (like Halo or CS:GO) on specialty servers
	I've always enjoyed playing this game. And that's not even mentioning modding. It was written in Java and later
	made into 2 seperate versions: Java Edition (the original one, obviously, written in Java), and the newer Bedrock edition
	is mainly written in C++. 
	
	2: Minecraft is definitely a video game. It's a sandbox game, but it is a video game. Video games are games played on consoles or computers,
	and Minecraft fits those conditions. I could even argue it's more than a video game. Some people use it as a game engine itself by recreating/
	making games inside of Minecraft with the use of server plugins or command blocks.
